REST asks developers to use HTTP methods explicitly and in a way that's consistent with the protocol definition. This basic REST design principle establishes a one-to-one mapping between create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) operations and HTTP methods. According to this mapping:

- GET = Retrieve a representation of a resource
- POST = Create if you are sending content to the server to create a subordinate of the specified resource collection, using some server-side algorithm.
- PUT = Create if you are sending the full content of the specified resource (URI).
- PUT = Update if you are updating the full content of the specified resource.
- DELETE = Delete if you are requesting the server to delete the resource
- PATCH = Update partial content of a resource
- OPTIONS = Get information about the communication options for the request URI
